**`[CONTEXT]`**

You are an expert Flutter developer and software architect with a deep specialization in the official MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture recommended by the Flutter team. You are proficient in analyzing API documentation, understanding mobile application source code, and creating clear, actionable technical documentation.

Your current task is to analyze the API documentation for an existing Flutter application, compare it with the app's current implementation, and document the necessary changes to align the application with the latest API specifications.

**`[OBJECTIVE]`**

To perform a gap analysis between the provided 'Auth' module API documentation and the current Flutter application's source code. Based on this analysis, you will produce a technical report outlining all the required modifications. This report will guide the development team in updating the application.

**`[INPUT DATA]`**

1.  **API Documentation:** You will analyze the documentation located in the `/docs` directory of the project. Your primary focus is the documentation related to the **Auth module**.
2.  **Application Source Code:** You have access to the entire source code of the current Flutter application, which follows the MVVM architecture.

**`[STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS]`**

1.  **Analyze the API Documentation:** Thoroughly review the API documentation for the 'Auth' module found in the `/docs` folder. Identify all endpoints, request/response models, data structures, and authentication flows.

2.  **Inspect the Current Application Code:** Examine the Flutter application's source code, focusing on the files related to authentication. This includes data models, repository/service layers, and ViewModels associated with login, registration, token management, and user sessions.

3.  **Perform the Comparison:** Compare the specifications from the API documentation against the existing implementation in the app. Identify all discrepancies, including but not limited to:
    * New, updated, or deprecated API endpoints.
    * Changes in request or response data models (e.g., new fields, removed fields, data type changes).
    * Modifications in the authentication logic or flow (e.g., new security headers, different token handling).

4.  **Generate the Analysis Document:** Based on your comparison, create a detailed report that outlines the necessary changes. Follow the output specifications below precisely.

**`[OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS]`**

1.  **Create a new directory:** Inside the `/docs` folder, create a new folder named `analytics`.
2.  **Create a new document:** Inside the newly created `/docs/analytics/` folder, create a document. You can name it `analise_api_auth.md`.
3.  **Language Requirement:** The entire content of this document **MUST be written in Portuguese (Brazil)**.
4.  **Content of the Document:** The document should be well-structured and include the following sections:
    * **`Resumo das Mudanças`**: A brief, high-level overview of the required updates.
    * **`Análise Detalhada das Mudanças na API`**: A detailed list of all changes found in the API documentation, categorizing them (e.g., Endpoints Novos, Endpoints Modificados, Endpoints Descontinuados, Mudanças nos Modelos de Dados).
    * **`Impacto no Código da Aplicação (Arquitetura MVVM)`**: Explain how the API changes will affect the current application code, structuring your analysis by the MVVM layers:
        * **`Models`**: Detail the changes needed in the Dart models to match the new API request/response structures.
        * **`Services/Repositories`**: Describe the modifications required in the service or repository layer responsible for API communication.
        * **`ViewModels`**: Explain the necessary adjustments to the ViewModels to handle the new data and logic.
    * **`Plano de Ação Recomendado`**: Provide a suggested, step-by-step plan for the development team to implement these changes efficiently.
